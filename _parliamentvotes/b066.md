An amendment that would fundamentally change the Judicial branch, which is not often used and seen as second best to becoming a Member of Parliament, allowing for those who may not be the most desirable by some to be appointed an agent of justice. Among other changes are updates to names, government groups, and the addition of already established practices such as the needing to be a citizen to be eligible for Parliament and Judgeship.
