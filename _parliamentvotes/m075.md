    be able to catch them if they do. Very unnecessary, might as well legislate against
    against rain.

I motion to close our airspace for the next two weeks. That will give us more than enough time to decide if and how we want to deal with airships in our territory. If any foreign airship is found flying within our territory between now and January 11th, it is to be destroyed and its occupants escorted out of the country, or pearled if they don't comply.
