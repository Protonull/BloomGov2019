The next general election is currently set to take place on the same week as Christmas, but a lot of people will be away with family or busy doing other things so I don't think it would be best to hold an election then. So I'm calling a motion to schedule the next general election to take place between Friday the 14th of December and Sunday the 16th of December. That way everything's all _wrapped up_ by Christmas.
