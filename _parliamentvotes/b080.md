We've came close to this though admittedly I've backed out at the last moment. Anyway, on the suggestion of Orinnari, I'm proposing to change the "President" to the "Monarch."

I was reluctant to do this before because it seems like we've been a republic for so long though the role of President isn't the same as it was when Bloom was first founded. Back then the President was what you would expect, could veto everything and basically co-ruled with the PM. When dBeatzx stopped being President I moved away from this since I didn't want to be the co-ruler. Which has meant that the current role of President is closer to the role of a constitutional monarch, where the powers are severely limited.
