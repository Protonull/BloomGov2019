A revision of [\[B072 - Constitutional Amendment for Executive Restructuring\]](./b072) that no longer changes the powers of the President, nor the secession rights of territories. It's an amendment that will re-introduce the Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary roles, as well as introduce a subordinate role: Junior Minister. [\[Reference\]](../../uploads/b073.pdf)
