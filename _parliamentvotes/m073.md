Motion to claim two new islands just east of our mainland. We do have a mesa but it's quite small and very far north. Claiming this it will allow \[our\] citizens to build their own farms and produce more than just beetroot and wheat. The forest biome that extends off of the mesa is essentially cleared already with the exception of some interesting custom jungle and spruce trees, could be settled in pretty easy.
