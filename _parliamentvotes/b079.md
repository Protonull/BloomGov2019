Now that Ness is back again he's continuing to work on Narda. It was bad luck that Narda's town status was removed last week when we assumed Ness had quit. Anyway, this amendment is just to give Narda its town status back, with Ness as its Mayor. [\[Reference\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HlluIyYxcbC81r9RjbuBNbpcqdTyitRZyDhCuqxCznE/edit)
