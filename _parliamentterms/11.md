Roughly five weeks after the term stated, both dBeatzx and iOminous stepped down due to inactivity, and were subsequently replaced at the ballot by BoomBox59 of the Activist Party, and Orinnari, an independent. Nessie97 stepped down shortly after and replaced by Xcios of the Activist Party.

Soon after though, Aleh essentially disbanded the Free Democratic Party and revived the Conservative Party, to which BoomBox59 and ShadiestMule51 formally of the Activist Party defected to.

A new party also arose, with Slushhi formally of the Activist Party being its only representative in Parliament.
